icalparser
=========

A set of tools in julia for reading data from an icalendar file (.ics). Incredibly simple, it started out with some cute functions that got a little bit gross as time constraints pushed upon me. 

### icalparse.parse
Takes as input a string, returns an array of dicts, each dict with each entry keyed intelligently from the calendar file's structure.
